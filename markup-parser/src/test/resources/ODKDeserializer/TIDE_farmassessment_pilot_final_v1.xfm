    Hello. My name is _____________ and I am working with the SNV Uganda under The Inclusive Dairy Enterprise Project (TIDE) and I am here to conduct a survey on dairy development in South Western Uganda. You have been selected for this survey because attended a training at one of the Practical Dairy Training Farms (PDTFs). The Inclusive Dairy Enterprise (TIDE) Project aims at improving the production in the dairy sector in several ways. We are interested to hear more about your dairy farm and the activities you implement at your farm. The total length of the interview will be about 4 hours. The information you give us is confidential and only the researchers will have access to it. Your participation is voluntary and you can choose to stop the survey any time you want. You may also choose not to answer any questions that you don't want to. You will not directly benefit from this survey. However, the information you will provide us may give important information to SNV Uganda and other parties involved in dairy to improve their policies to improve their service delivery, and you may indirectly benefit from that.
